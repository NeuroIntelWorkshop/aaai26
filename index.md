## Topics
The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable progress. However, conventional deep learning approaches frequently encounter limitations in energy efficiency, real-time processing, and adaptability within dynamic environments. Neuromorphic intelligence presents a compelling paradigm shift, inspired by the brain's exceptionally efficient and parallel processing capabilities.

This workshop aims to highlight interdisciplinary advances in neuromorphic intelligence, from software algorithms to hardware systems , as well as their synergistic co-design. 

## Format of Workshop
The workshop aims to attract submissions of long (max. 8 pages) and short (max. 4 pages) papers that delve into the fascinating realm of Neuromorphic Intelligence. 

The submissions that present theoretical advancements, practical applications, and experimental results that push the boundaries of energy-efficient and real-time AI solutions inspired by the brain and neural systems, are encouraged.
